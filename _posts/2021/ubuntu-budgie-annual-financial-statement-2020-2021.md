<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All Ubuntu Budgie team members including myself are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher. For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 10x the current contribution rate to achieve that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Canonical Support</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although we are an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical. Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.</p>
