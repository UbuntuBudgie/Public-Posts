t not often you get to change the face of a distro - so here is your chance.

Our default desktop, much of our website artwork has used this picture.
<div class="uk-overlay uk-overlay-hover uk-visible-hover">

<img src="https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/budgie-desk.png" alt="Budgie desk" />
<div class="uk-overlay-panel uk-overlay-background uk-overlay-fade"></div>
</div>
As we approach 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), we are offering up for you to change our default artwork. Can you do better?

Competition time - the contest closes at the end of November 2017.

We are looking for inspirational artwork - something that gives an immediate visual impact. Abstract is best - it must be recognisable when:
<ol>
 	<li>cropped as a horizontal banner,</li>
 	<li>scaled to a small image size 256x256</li>
 	<li>has application windows covering most of the picture</li>
</ol>
<div class="uk-overlay uk-overlay-hover uk-visible-hover">

<img src="https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/xplo-header.jpg" alt="Xplo header" />
<div class="uk-overlay-panel uk-overlay-background uk-overlay-fade"></div>
</div>
Entry is via email - send entries to <a href="mailto:ubuntubudgiecompetition@gmail.com">ubuntubudgiecompetition@gmail.com </a>

Here is a great incentive. For the winner, you can select as many of our spectacular Ubuntu Budgie shop goodies up-to-the value of $60
