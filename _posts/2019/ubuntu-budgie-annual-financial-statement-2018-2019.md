<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>As part of our commitment to be transparent with the community, the team is pleased to present a short statement of our financial position covering 2018 to 2019.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Budgie Remix had launched in April 2016</li>
<li>In Nov 2016 Ubuntu Budgie was granted the status as an official community flavour with Ubuntu/Canonical. </li>
<li>17.04 was our first release &quot;official&quot; release as a flavour.</li>
<li>18.04 was our first Long Term Schedule release</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>As we close off our fiscal year for 2019 (Apr 2018 - Mar 31, 2019), the financial position of the project is very healthy.  We have met several goals this year and including our stretch goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTS Fiscal Goal - ensure that the costs to support a three-year LTS were in place.</li>
<li>Contribute on behalf of the Ubuntu Budgie community - a financial contribution for 2017 was donated to the Solus community since Solus provides much of the development behind the Budgie Desktop.  Solus themeselves stopped donations in 2018.  We will keep reserves available if and when Solus restart donation receipts.</li>
<li>Stretch Goal - ensure we have reserves to meet five years of costs (2019 - 2023).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operating Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure costs relating to the website, test build servers, domain registrations</li>
<li>Reserves are in place as a contingency to account for unexpected expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/it-s-all-thanks-to-you">Donations</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Patreon</em></p>
<p>For 2018-2019 we did have a handful of <strong>Patreon</strong> donors. Please do consider becoming a <strong>Patreon</strong> since this gives Ubuntu Budgie a regular income.</p>
<p><em>PayPal</em></p>
<p>We have had many individuals who donate via <strong>Paypal</strong>, and we thank you all!</p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship</strong></p>
<p><em>Digital Ocean</em></p>
<p>We have had a significant vote of confidence by <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> paying for all of our 2017/2018 hosting and infrastructure fees and we hope to continue our partnership through the 2019-2020 fiscal year as well.

<p><em>Discourse</em></p>
<p>Last year we moved our community over to a discourse forum which was generously provided through sponsorship as well.
<a href="https://www.discourse.org/">https://www.discourse.org/</a></p>
<p><em>Status.io</em></p>
<p>While this is yet to be implemented on our part, Status.io has provided a sponsorship that will help us keep our community up to date with system interruptions in our infrastructure.

<p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Briefly, we have explored a partnership with Tuxedo Computers to see computers with Ubuntu Budgie preinstalled on systems.  Discussion is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Future Goals</strong></p>
<p>Last year we set our sights this year to meet two very sizable cost goals; looking to fund equipment with  HiDPI capability and with multiple HiDPI monitors.  We recognise that more and more of our community use multi monitors and increasingly with HiDPI type resolutions.  Through your contributions we have enough money to purchase a couple of HiDPI monitors. </p>
<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This year our community has contributed £2919.</li>
<li>We have a nominal £3477.33 in the bank, with set-aside costs for 2019 to 2023 + reserves.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Our confidence level for our financial viability is as close to 100% as you can get.</p>
<p>As a comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016-2017, our community contributed £248.90 with no set-aside costs and no reserves</li>
<li>2017-2018, our community contributed £2460 with set-aside costs for 2018 to 2022 + reserves</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>With your help, we look forward to making more donations to developers and organisations who have helped Ubuntu Budgie.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>All Ubuntu Budgie team members including myself are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher.  For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 10x the current contribution rate to achieve that.</p>
<p><strong>Canonical Support</strong></p>
<p>Although we are an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical.  Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.</p>

<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p>All donors are displayed on our website unless you specifically request not to be presented.</p>
<p><strong>Donations</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to <a href="@page/5">support Ubuntu Budgie</a>, please feel free to donate to the project through either <strong>Paypal</strong> or <strong>Patreon</strong>. </p>
<p>Thank you to all who have chosen to join our community.</p>
