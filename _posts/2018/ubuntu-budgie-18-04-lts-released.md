We are pleased to announce the **release** of the next version of our distro, the third as an official flavor of the **Ubuntu** family and our very first LTS.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

Based on 17.10 experiences, feedback and suggestions we have received from our users, the new release comes with a lot of **new features**, **fixes** and **optimizations**

Here is what you can expect with the new release:

* More customisation options via budgie welcome
* Lots more Budgie Applets available to be installed
* Dynamic Workspaces, hot-corners and Window Shuffler
* Brand new GTK+ Theme called Pocillo
* New applets as standard in the panel or available to be added via Budgie Settings

You can read more about what we have been upto via our <a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2018/03/08/18-04-release-notes">release notes</a>. Upgrade instructions from both 16.04 budgie-remix and 17.10 are included. Please have a read of these since there is an extra step you need to do post-upgrade.

<a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads"><strong>Download</strong> links</a> and installation guide are provided. As always - do check the md5sum hash value of the downloaded ISO - this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

If you have any questions, remember, our <a href="https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/">forum</a> is always open and ready to help you.

**Thank you all** for your continued support - **spread the news!**

David, Ubuntu Budgie Project Leader.
