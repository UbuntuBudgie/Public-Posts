We are pleased to announce the <strong>release</strong> of the next version of our distro, our first LTS point release as an official flavor of the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> family.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations the Ubuntu Budgie team have released since the 18.04 release in April this year:
<ul>
 	<li>budgie welcome updates including new applets Desktop Weather, Advanced Brightness Controller, Browser Profile Launcher &amp; Find 'Fast' Kangaroo Applet</li>
 	<li>Lots more translation updates to budgie welcome</li>
 	<li>Fixes to display Settings correctly translated</li>
 	<li>Six bug &amp; stability fixes for various applets</li>
</ul>
We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian &amp; Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.
