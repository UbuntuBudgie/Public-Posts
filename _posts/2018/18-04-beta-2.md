Beta 2 of Ubuntu Budgie has been released (5th April) - one short month after beta 1! This is the final beta before the actual release on the 26th April.

For beta 2 we have concentrated on bug-fixing and smoothing off those rough edges our user community have reported. As always - if you haven't told us about an issue ... we don't know about it - and that includes all the vloggers out there!

So in no particular order beta 2 has the following changes over and above <a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/admin/blog/post/@blog/id?id=35">beta 1 </a>.
<ul>
 	<li>Weather Applet: We have managed to get this working again. Yay! Available from Menu - budgie-applets</li>
 	<li>Budgie Calendar Applet: backports a fix from upstream to ensure custom date format are remembered + styling fixes for themes like Pocillo</li>
 	<li>Ant-Theme - latest git version of Ant-Theme is available that includes some nice budgie desktop fixes</li>
 	<li>Pocillo theme:
<ul>
 	<li>theming of the lock-screen</li>
 	<li>Pocillo now support slick-greeter theming - switched slick-greeter theme to Pocillo-dark, with a more transparent entry field</li>
 	<li>better headerbar styling of the window controls; fixed black separator displays</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Arc theme has styling fixes for for various issues with budgie desktop, gnome-shell and cinnamon</li>
 	<li>TLP no longer pulls in the Postfix mail-server</li>
 	<li>Showtime Applet now can display 12 and 24hr date format</li>
 	<li>Show the default Ubuntu Budgie icon for budgie-welcome/themes and applets for those users not using Pocillo icon theme - before no icon was shown</li>
 	<li>Showtime Applet now displays correctly on HiDPI screens</li>
 	<li>Hotcorners Applet trigger mechanism takes into account how close the cursor is to a corner - it is less likely now to trigger accidently</li>
 	<li>Window Shuffler is brand-new - GUI and keyboard based grid tiling comes to budgie (see later)</li>
 	<li>Added a fix for the Budgie Desktop system tray to hopefully resolve black-backgrounds and superimposed icons</li>
 	<li>Window Previews now correctly displays when activated via Budgie Settings</li>
 	<li>Budgie Welcome has had a whole series of changes
<ul>
 	<li>Budgie Welcome now launches on the live ISO session</li>
 	<li>Our discourse support site is now displayed on the home-page. The social media icons have moved to the right of the screen and Gitter has now been removed (since discourse is our new support site)</li>
 	<li>Community page has been revamped</li>
 	<li>Lots of translation updates</li>
 	<li>Recommendations - Flatpack install now works</li>
 	<li>In-line with Ubuntu Policy, third-party repo installs now displays a prompt. Accepting that prompt continues with the installation and adds the third-party repo e.g. Chrome, Vivaldi, Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA</li>
 	<li>Vimix theme is now installable via our backports PPA since the third-party we originally linked to is not actively maintaining its package</li>
 	<li>Skippy-XD has now been removed from the recommendations page - the software is unmaintained for a few years now. It is still installable via command-line through our backports PPA on a "try if it works" basis.</li>
 	<li>Vivaldi is no longer shown on the 32bit ISO - there is no 32bit packages available</li>
 	<li>snap version is displayed on the Welcome About icon</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Our budgie-plymouth package has now received a fix to stop upgrades crashing when moving from 18.04 --&gt; 20.04 or from 18.04 --&gt; 18.10. We will be backporting this fix for 17.10 and budgie-remix 16.04</li>
 	<li>Minimal install:
<ul>
 	<li>Budgie Welcome now launches on the minimal installation</li>
 	<li>More packages have been removed to cleanup the minimal installation</li>
 	<li>Minimal install now defaults to Pocillo GTK theme and Pocillo icon theme to ensure commonality with the full install</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
