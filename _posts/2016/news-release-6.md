After taking a bit of a breather over the summer holidays the team are back in full swing.
<h4>FUNDRAISING</h4>

We have had a substantial financial donation – thanks Felix!

We do need <strong>you</strong> to help us to remain a viable distro – so if you can afford the cost of just one of your favourite coffee in a month, please consider help us with a small donation.

Paypal is gratefully accepted – regular donors via Patreon would be great!  More details on our <a href="https://budgie-remix.org/support-us/">Support Us</a> web-page.

Also we have opened a new team member opportunity – <a href="https://budgie-remix.org/opportunities/">fundraiser</a>.  We hope you can join.  Drop in to our <a href="https://gitter.im/budgie-remix/community">Gitter community chatroom</a> to discuss.
<h4>16.10 ALPHA</h4>
We put together our 16.10 alpha – many thanks for all our testers.  The feedback has been valuable.

<h4></h4>
<h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
Unfortunately we have decided to drop (at least for 16.10) our change to a new greeter.  This is due to serious upstream issues affecting Debian and Ubuntu that have now (as yet) not been resolved.

We are pleased that more of the<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=budgie&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=yakkety&amp;section=all"> budgie-remix packages</a> have now been made available directly from the Ubuntu Universe Repos.  We are nearly there with our aim to get all of the budgie-remix packages into the Ubuntu repositories – a prerequisite for our Official Community Flavour Status application to be considered by the Ubuntu Technical Board.

<h4>FUTURE PLANS</h4>
We are exploring creating a new icon-theme that blends Moka with Arc themed icons – more news on this in the future hopefully … but to give you a flavour – a few Arc-coloured icons from various icon-themes and what we are currently considering for the Files folder icon.
