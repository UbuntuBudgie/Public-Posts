<h4>BUDGIE-REMIX 16.04.1</h4>
budgie-remix 16.04.1 has been <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/16.04.1%20release/">released </a>and we’ve updated a lot of different components.

<h4>BUDGIE WELCOME APP</h4>
Look out for the new <strong>Budgie Welcome</strong> app – it’s in your <em>System Tools</em> menu group.

Lots of updates have been made available since the 16.04.1 iso. For eg, panel resets is straightforward:
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube"><iframe class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJrf41uy_N0?version=3&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></span></div>
Previewing in the latest updates – switch your desktop from the clean and simple Arc theme to a gorgeous Material theme and icons. More on that in the next newsletter.
<h4>NEW IMPROVEMENTS</h4>
We’ve updated the <code>budgie-screenshot-applet which should work better than the previous version. We've also updated the Budgie desktop environment package, adding in a few recommendations.</code>
<ul>
 	<li><code>nautilus-share</code>: this makes samba sharing using GNOME Files file manager a snip</li>
 	<li><code>policy-desktop-privileges</code>: you should notice a few areas where previously you needed to use <code>sudo</code> you no longer have to.</li>
 	<li><code>ppa-purge</code>: a must for those using PPAs - allows you to remove and rollback PPA's easily</li>
 	<li><code>gnome-system-monitor</code>: visual tool to help find out what is apps and processes are running.</li>
 	<li><code>bash-completion</code>: must have package for those that use terminals alot</li>
 	<li><code>thermald</code>: for newer Sandy Bridge based and later laptops your laptop should run much cooler now</li>
 	<li><code>acpi-support</code>: support for various wireless scripts and hardware</li>
 	<li><code>gvfs-fuse</code>: GNOME's virtual filesystem - various GNOME apps recognize and mounts filesystems automatically now</li>
</ul>
Due to GTK 3.20 not landing soon enough for updating the themes and testing it, we regret to inform you the budgie-remix 16.10 ISO release will be delayed a little.
