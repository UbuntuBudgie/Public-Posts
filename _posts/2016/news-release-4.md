With our fourth news batch, we have some interesting news about budgie-remix’s development and other community related stuff.

Encryption and locale bug that were present during the installation are now fixed. Encryption now works properly and can be turned on/off depending on your choice in our 16.04.1 ISOs that will be soon available for download and available for general use.

Our team leader <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fossfreedom">David “fossfreedom” Mohammed</a>, has become an official Ubuntu member with 100% votes for him to join! David encourages all Ubuntu users to consider <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership">membership</a>.

We’ve updated our default selection of wallpapers that come with budgie-remix.

If you have suggestion on possible new wallpaper that would fit the distro you can always contact us via social networks or via comments on this post. We will be running a 16.10 wallpaper competition so we urge you to seek out the best wallpapers and submit these when the competition is announced in the next couple of weeks.

The welcome app has received more polishing and we have now added specification option that will list your computer’s hardware specification (System Properties). See it in action:
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube"><iframe class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5uohe5vUcc?version=3&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-ratio="0.6228373702422145" data-width="1156" data-height="720" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></span></div>
Some of our packages focusing on the visual part of the distro, have been accepted into Debian repositories (<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/moka-icon-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moka-icon-theme</a>, <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/faba-icon-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faba-icon-theme</a> and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/arc-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arc-theme</a>) and so got synced into the development version of Ubuntu as well. Hopefully, our budgie-desktop package too will be soon available in the repos, as soon as it gets approved by maintainers.

We’ve also added an applet from the fabulous developer <a href="https://github.com/cybre">Stefan Ric</a> that will allow you to capture screenshots; you can also upload captured images straight to Imgur image hosting service so that you can use it later on. To install, just run this in terminal:
<pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> apt install budgie-screenshot-applet</code></pre>
Then add the applet to a panel using Raven
