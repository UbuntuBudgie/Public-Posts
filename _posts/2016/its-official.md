The budgie-remix team is pleased to inform the community that the <a href="http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting-2/2016/ubuntu-meeting-2.2016-11-08-17.01.log.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu Technical Board</a> has granted official community flavor status to our distro.  We are pleased to join and be part-of the superb  Ubuntu family.

Starting from today the distro will be known as <strong>Ubuntu Budgie</strong>.

We now move full steam ahead and look forward to working with the Ubuntu Developer Membership Board to examine and work through the technical aspects. Working together will allow us to be adhere to community  standards that other flavors follow. 17.04 will be our first official release under the new name.

We have come a long way in a short time with our first 16.04 release - a major update at 16.04.1 as well as following and taking active part with the Ubuntu release cadence for 16.10.

So what does official flavor status mean? Apart from the obvious official build and hosting facilities - the new Ubuntu Budgie community will be able to take part and officially access help sites such as Ask Ubuntu, Ubuntu Forums, wiki.ubuntu.com, Launchpad.net and others. All of us will share an equal status in the wider Ubuntu family.

There is still lots of things to be done to successfully reach 17.04 Ubuntu Budgie release.  This is an opportunity for everyone to take an active part.  Changing from budgie-remix to Ubuntu Budgie is a massive job - software changes, packaging updates, merging updates upstream, testing the results.  We want everyone to come on-board.  Join us through all our social media channels and let us know how you can help.

Don't forget you can massively help us through <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3038166&amp;ty=h&amp;u=3038166">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=ZZZLS8W5QC8US">Paypal</a>.  The donations go forward to help all developers who have directly or indirectly contributed their time and effort to budgie-remix and the future Ubuntu Budgie and to cover operational costs.  Without the open-source community Ubuntu Budgie wouldn't be reality.

We would like to give huge thanks to 16.04 and 16.10 budgie-remix users for continuing to support us - we have exciting changes lined up over the next few months - chief among these will be budgie-desktop 11.  We aim to bring this exciting new desktop update as soon as possible.  16.04.2 in February '17 will have all the very latest updates and of course 17.04 beckons.
